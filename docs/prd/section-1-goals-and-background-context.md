# Section 1: Goals and Background Context

## Goals (Scientifically Validated & Phased)

**Phase 1a Goals (Weeks 1-8):**
- Prevent herbicide carryover disasters through constraint checking
- Enable basic field management with Neo4j graph structure  
- Deliver $10-15/acre value from prevented mistakes
- Establish foundation for 5 pilot farms

**Phase 1b Goals (Weeks 9-16):**
- Enable yield predictions with Â±12 bu/acre MAE for wheat
- Optimize insurance portfolios for $8-12/acre savings
- Integrate real weather data with uncertainty
- Scale to 25 pilot farms

**Phase 2 Goals (Months 5-8):**
- Achieve full $40-60/acre value proposition
- Enable network effects with 50+ participating farms
- Deliver 45-55% recommendation adoption rate
- Provide causal inference with strip trial validation

**Long-term Vision:**
- Build comprehensive agricultural knowledge graph
- Enable 25% reduction in decision-making time
- Distinguish correlational from causal relationships
- Scale to 500+ farms across Western Kansas

## Background Context

FarmCalc addresses the critical challenge of profitable dryland farming in Hamilton County's 17-inch rainfall environment with 35% precipitation variability. Current decision-making results in $75,000-120,000 annual losses for average 3,000-acre operations due to suboptimal rotation choices, inadequate insurance coverage, and mistimed planting decisions. FarmCalc's unique graph-intelligence platform models agriculture as an interconnected system where field adjacency, rotation history, herbicide carryover, and regional patterns critically influence outcomes. By combining Neo4j's graph algorithms for pattern discovery with rigorous statistical validation and agronomic constraints, the platform identifies successful strategies from similar operations while respecting critical factors like plant-back restrictions, equipment compatibility, and weather uncertainty. The system provides transparent recommendations that outperform conventional methods by 20-30% in validated strip trials, with clear explanations of confidence levels and underlying assumptions.
