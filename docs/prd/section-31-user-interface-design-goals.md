# Section 3.1: User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The FarmCalc interface pioneers "Graph-Driven Agricultural Intelligence" where every farm decision is understood through its network of relationships. The design philosophy centers on "see the connections, understand the outcomes" - visualizing how fields influence each other, how rotations cascade through time, and how regional patterns affect individual farms. Users navigate through an interactive knowledge graph that mirrors how farming actually works - as an interconnected system, not isolated data points. The AI assistant explains recommendations by showing paths through the graph, making complex relationships intuitive.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Graph-First Navigation:** Primary interaction through interactive network visualization showing fields, their relationships, and influence flows
- **AI-Guided Data Entry:** Every input field has contextual AI assistance that validates against the knowledge graph
- **Temporal Graph Scrubbing:** Timeline slider reveals how the farm network evolved and will evolve with different decisions
- **What-If Graph Cloning:** Parallel universe exploration by cloning subgraphs and modifying parameters
- **Influence Flow Visualization:** Animated particles showing how decisions propagate through the network
- **Conversational Graph Queries:** Natural language questions translated to Cypher queries with visual results

## Core Screens and Views

- **Network Command Center:** 3D force-directed graph of farm ecosystem with fields, crops, weather events as nodes
- **Rotation Pattern Explorer:** Temporal graph showing successful rotation sequences discovered from similar farms
- **Disease/Pest Spread Map:** Real-time network showing infection risks and transmission paths
- **Influence Network Dashboard:** Visualize how neighboring farms' practices affect your outcomes
- **Knowledge Graph Browser:** Explore K-State research connections to your specific conditions
- **Causal Path Analyzer:** Interactive diagram showing cause-effect chains from actions to outcomes
- **Community Detection View:** Identify clusters of similar fields for management zones
- **Graph-Enhanced Charts Suite:** Traditional charts augmented with relationship overlays
- **What-If Scenario Lab:** Side-by-side graph comparison of different decision paths

## Accessibility
**WCAG AA Compliance with Graph Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation through graph nodes, screen reader descriptions of relationships, high contrast mode preserving network structure

## Branding

Graph-centric aesthetic where relationships are the hero elements. Node colors represent entity types (fields: green, crops: gold, weather: blue, diseases: red). Edge thickness shows relationship strength. Smooth force-directed animations reinforce network dynamics. Clean backgrounds let the graph structure shine.

## Target Device and Platforms
**Web Responsive with Graph Optimization** - Desktop-first for complex graph exploration (1920x1080), tablet for field review with simplified graphs, progressive web app with offline graph caching
