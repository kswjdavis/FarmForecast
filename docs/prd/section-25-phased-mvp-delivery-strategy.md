# Section 2.5: Phased MVP Delivery Strategy

## Phase 1a: Foundation & Core Value (Weeks 1-8)
**Goal:** Establish platform with immediate value through constraint checking

**Includes:**
- Epic 1: Foundation & Graph Infrastructure
- Epic 2 (Partial): Herbicide carryover network, Equipment compatibility
- Basic rotation recommendations based on constraints
- Manual data entry with validation

**Delivers:**
- Prevents herbicide disasters (immediate value)
- Basic field management
- Equipment compatibility checking
- $10-15/acre value from prevented mistakes

## Phase 1b: Intelligence Layer (Weeks 9-16)
**Goal:** Add predictive capabilities with proper uncertainty

**Includes:**
- Epic 2 (Complete): Full data integration
- Epic 3: Prediction engine with uncertainty
- Epic 4 (Partial): Basic optimization

**Delivers:**
- Yield predictions with confidence intervals
- Weather integration
- Insurance optimization
- Additional $15-25/acre value

## Phase 2: Network Effects (Months 5-8)
**Goal:** Enable collaborative learning and advanced features

**Includes:**
- Epic 4 (Complete): Full optimization
- Epic 5: Collaborative network
- Epic 6: Advanced visualization

**Delivers:**
- Network learning benefits
- Strip trial framework
- Full $40-60/acre value proposition

## Data Bootstrap Strategy

**Initial Data Acquisition (Pre-Launch):**
1. **Partner with K-State Extension**
   - Access to 20+ years variety trial data
   - Historical weather patterns
   - Validated rotation studies

2. **Pilot Farm Program (5 farms)**
   - Free first year for complete historical data
   - Weekly feedback sessions
   - Strip trial participation required
   - Provides initial 500+ fields

3. **Data Quality Incentives:**
   - $100 credit for 5+ years clean yield data
   - $50 credit for complete herbicide history
   - Free soil testing for participants

4. **Transfer Learning Approach:**
   - Start with Western Kansas aggregate models
   - Progressively refine with local data
   - Minimum 100 fields before farm-specific models

## Risk Mitigation Through Phasing

**Phase 1a Risks (LOW):**
- Herbicide checking is rule-based (no ML required)
- Equipment constraints are deterministic
- Immediate value from prevented mistakes

**Phase 1b Risks (MEDIUM):**
- Need 500+ fields for reliable predictions
- Weather API dependencies
- User acceptance of uncertainty

**Phase 2 Risks (MEDIUM-HIGH):**
- Requires critical mass of users
- Privacy concerns
- Network effect timing
