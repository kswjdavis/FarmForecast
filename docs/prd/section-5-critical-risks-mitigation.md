# Section 5: Critical Risks & Mitigation

## Technical Risks

**Weather Uncertainty (HIGH)**
- Risk: 35% precipitation variability makes predictions inherently uncertain
- Mitigation: Always show confidence intervals, use ensemble forecasts, emphasize risk management over point predictions

**Data Sparsity (HIGH)**
- Risk: Many fields lack sufficient historical data for ML
- Mitigation: Use hierarchical models to borrow strength across fields, require minimum data thresholds, transfer learning from similar regions

**Herbicide Carryover Liability (HIGH)**
- Risk: Incorrect rotation recommendation could cause crop failure
- Mitigation: Conservative plant-back restrictions, require user confirmation of herbicide history, disclaimer on all recommendations

## Agronomic Risks

**Strip Trial Validation (MEDIUM)**
- Risk: Recommendations may not validate in real field conditions
- Mitigation: Partner with K-State Extension for trials, start with low-risk recommendations, track outcomes rigorously

**Equipment Constraints (MEDIUM)**
- Risk: Optimal rotation may not match farmer's equipment
- Mitigation: Capture equipment inventory upfront, include as hard constraints in optimization

## Market Risks

**Adoption Resistance (HIGH)**
- Risk: Farmers skeptical of "black box" recommendations
- Mitigation: Full explainability, show comparable farms' success, start with advisory not prescriptive mode

**Competitor Response (MEDIUM)**
- Risk: Climate FieldView or Granular could add similar features
- Mitigation: Focus on dryland-specific expertise, deeper K-State integration, local relationships
