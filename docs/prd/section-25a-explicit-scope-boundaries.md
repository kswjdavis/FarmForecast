# Section 2.5a: Explicit Scope Boundaries

## OUT OF SCOPE for Initial Phases

**Phase 1a-1b Will NOT Include:**
- Automated execution of any farming operations
- Livestock or grazing management
- Irrigation scheduling (dryland only)
- Direct equipment control or variable rate prescriptions
- Commodity marketing/trading execution
- Loan applications or financial services
- Mobile native applications (PWA only)
- Offline operation beyond basic caching

**Phase 2 Will NOT Include:**
- International expansion
- Crops beyond wheat, corn, sorghum, and approved alternatives
- Direct carbon credit trading (documentation only)
- Automated chemical purchasing
- Farm equipment marketplace
- Labor management
- Crop insurance sales (optimization only)

**Permanently Out of Scope:**
- GMO trait recommendations (regulatory complexity)
- Pesticide application without human verification
- Financial investment advice
- Land purchase/rental negotiations
- Direct government payment applications

## Simplifications for MVP

**Accepted Simplifications to Reduce Complexity:**
1. **Weather 20/20:** Manual entry only (no API initially)
2. **Soil Testing:** Manual entry or PDF parsing (no direct lab APIs initially)
3. **Market Prices:** Daily updates sufficient (not real-time)
4. **Graph Visualization:** 2D only initially (3D in Phase 2)
5. **Strip Trials:** Basic randomization (advanced designs in Phase 2)
6. **ML Models:** Start with Random Forest (GNNs in Phase 1b)
7. **Causal Inference:** Associations first, causality after validation
