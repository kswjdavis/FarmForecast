- 25+ paying customers
- Break-even on operations

## Timeline Reality Check

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Neo4j setup must complete before any development (Week 1)
2. Herbicide rules must be encoded before recommendations (Week 3)
3. Weather integration required for predictions (Week 5)
4. Pilot farms needed for real data (Week 2 recruitment)
5. Full season required for strip trial validation (Month 12+)

**Risk Buffers Built In:**
- 2 week buffer between phases
- Start with rule-based before ML
- Manual processes before automation
- Advisory mode before prescriptive
