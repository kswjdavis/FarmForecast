notes: |
  Story 1.1 demonstrates exemplary implementation of a secure credential management system:
  - Three-layer security model (plain .env, encrypted vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
  - All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  - Comprehensive automation for setup and onboarding
  - Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
  - Proper secret masking throughout the codebase
  - All tests passing (12/12 unit tests)
  - Type checking and linting passing after minor fixes
  
  The implementation exceeds expectations for security-critical infrastructure.
