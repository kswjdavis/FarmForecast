# Why Weather Is In Epic 2

1. **Business Critical**: Can't deliver $10-15/acre Phase 1a value without it
2. **Authentication Context**: Weather data is user/farm specific
3. **Performance**: Prefetch during login for instant dashboard
4. **Data Foundation**: Later features build on weather history
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple fallback layers ensure reliability

This structure ensures weather integration cannot be deferred or forgotten, as it's essential for Phase 1a value delivery.
