# Why This Works

1. **Story 1.0 is IMPOSSIBLE to skip** - All other stories have technical dependencies on it
2. **Automated verification** - Scripts verify connections before allowing work
3. **Git hooks prevent progress** - Can't even commit code without credentials
4. **CI/CD enforces compliance** - Builds fail without external services
5. **Developer experience** - Clear error messages guide to Story 1.0 completion

This structure makes external dependency configuration an integral part of the development flow, not an optional checklist.
