- Weather APIs: Visual Crossing and NOAA tokens
- GitHub repository at kswjdavis/FarmForecast
- Domain: fredfarmsystem.com (Netlify hosting)

- **Cache:** Redis 7.2.5
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring:** DataDog

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-performance.md]:
- Input validation using Pydantic + Zod schemas
- Token management: 15-min access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens

- Strict CSP headers required

**Deployment Environments** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]:
- Development: http://localhost:3000 (frontend), http://localhost:4000 (backend)
- Staging: https://staging.farmcalc.app
- Production: https://farmcalc.app

**File Structure Locations** (based on Next.js/FastAPI pattern):
- Frontend configuration: `/apps/web/.env.local`
- Backend configuration: `/apps/api/.env`
- Scripts location: `/scripts/`
- CI/CD workflows: `/.github/workflows/`
- Infrastructure code: `/infrastructure/aws/`

**Existing Files to Enhance**:
- `/scripts/verify-credentials.js` - Already created, needs vault integration
- `/.env` - Currently using plain text, needs vault encryption
- `/.gitignore` - Already excludes .env files

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest 2.0.5 for frontend, pytest 8.3.2 for backend
- **Test Location:** Tests co-located with source files as `*.test.ts` or `*_test.py`
- **Required Coverage:** Minimum 80% for credential handling code
- **Test Types Required:**
  - Unit tests for credential loading functions
  - Integration tests for AWS Secrets Manager access
  - E2E test for full credential verification flow
- **Mock Requirements:** Mock all external service calls in unit tests
- **Security Testing:** Include tests for credential masking and encryption

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The credential management infrastructure implementation demonstrates excellent security practices and comprehensive coverage. The multi-layered security approach (plain .env, encrypted vault, AWS Secrets Manager) provides flexibility across environments while maintaining security. The code is well-structured, follows TypeScript best practices, and includes proper error handling with retry logic.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Node.js/TypeScript conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Properly organized in src/ with services and utils
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests with 80%+ coverage requirement
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for credential management (252 lines of tests)
- [x] Proper error handling with exponential backoff in verify-credentials.js
- [x] Secret masking in logs to prevent accidental exposure
- [x] Automated rotation support for encryption keys
- [x] CI/CD integration with secret masking and security scans
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for AWS Secrets Manager error scenarios
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for failed credential verifications
- [ ] Consider implementing credential caching to reduce AWS API calls
- [ ] Add more granular IAM permissions documentation

### Security Review

Excellent security posture:
- No hardcoded secrets found
- Proper encryption at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Secure credential loading with environment-based vault selection
- Secret masking in logs and CI/CD output
- Security scanning integrated (TruffleHog, GitLeaks)
- Proper .gitignore configuration

Minor recommendations:
- Consider implementing shorter rotation intervals for production secrets
- Add audit logging for credential access

### Performance Considerations

- Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents API throttling
- Efficient credential loading with singleton pattern
- Consider implementing caching layer for frequently accessed secrets to reduce AWS API calls

### Files Modified During Review

None - All code meets quality standards.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-credential-management-infrastructure.yml
